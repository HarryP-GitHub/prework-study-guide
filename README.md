# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage is used as a guide for the precourse work that will help me along my journey of becoming a software engineer. Because there are many things to learn, this webpage contains key components from coding with HTML, CSS and Javascript. From the precourse content, I have learnt how to use GitHub, Git Bash and how to make a webpage using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
